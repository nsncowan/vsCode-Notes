1. `forEach()`: Executes a provided function once for each array element.

2. `map()`: Creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the array.

3. `filter()`: Creates a new array with all elements that pass a test specified by a provided function.

4. `reduce()`: Applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value.

5. `reduceRight()`: Applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from right to left) to reduce it to a single value.

6. `some()`: Checks if at least one element in the array passes a test specified by a provided function.

7. `every()`: Checks if all elements in the array pass a test specified by a provided function.

8. `find()`: Returns the first element in the array that satisfies a provided testing function.

9. `findIndex()`: Returns the index of the first element in the array that satisfies a provided testing function.

10. `indexOf()`: Returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present.

11. `lastIndexOf()`: Returns the last index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present.

12. `includes()`: Determines whether an array contains a specific element.

13. `sort()`: Sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array.

14. `reverse()`: Reverses the order of the elements in an array in place.

15. `keys()`: Returns a new array iterator that contains the keys of the array.

16. `values()`: Returns a new array iterator that contains the values of the array.

17. `entries()`: Returns a new array iterator that contains key/value pairs for each index in the array.

18. `flatMap()`: Maps each element using a mapping function, then flattens the result into a new array.

19. `from()`: Creates a new array instance from an array-like or iterable object.

20. `of()`: Creates a new array instance with a variable number of elements.
