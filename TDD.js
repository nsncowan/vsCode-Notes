  html-webpack-plugin: will allow us to easily generate HTML files based on templates.

  webpack-dev-server will automatically reload our code in the browser as we make changes to it. Great for development!

  eslint is a code analysis tool that we can set up to automatically review our code and notify us when any code is poorly-written or has errors. This helps us quickly identify and fix bugs.
