## 5. Immutability
- Immutability is a fundamental concept in functional programming.
- Immutability means that values in variables, objects, and arrays cannot be changed.
- In functional programming, new variables, objects, or arrays are created instead of modifying existing ones.
- The use of `let` indicates mutability, while `const` signifies immutability.
- Functional programming prioritizes immutability to enhance code reliability and prevent bugs.
- Using immutability allows developers to communicate intentions clearly and avoid unexpected changes in code.

## 6. Imperative Versus Declarative Programming
- Imperative programming explicitly states all steps to achieve a result, while declarative programming focuses on defining the desired result and letting the program decide how to achieve it.
- Imperative programming provides specific instructions, while declarative programming describes the end goal.
- Declarative programming is commonly used in HTML, where the focus is on the end result rather than individual steps.
- The map() function in JavaScript is an example of declarative programming, allowing the program to handle most of the work.
- Declarative code is considered more reusable, readable, and collaborative compared to imperative code.

## 7. Pure Functions (more detail in separate file)
- Pure functions always return the same output for a given input.
- Pure functions cannot return random or different results with the same input.
- Pure functions always return an output and cannot return nothing.
- Pure functions cannot have side effects and should not alter anything outside the function.
- Pure functions cannot rely on external variables or state.
- Pure functions are easier to test and ensure code quality.
- Pure functions can be analyzed in isolation without considering the rest of the application.
- Pure functions result in fewer bugs and are beneficial in larger codebases.
- Pure functions are important in both functional programming and object-oriented programming approaches.
