## succinct bullet points on the lesson about pure functions
- Pure functions always return the same output for a given input.
- Pure functions cannot return random or different results with the same input.
- Pure functions always return an output and cannot return nothing.
- Pure functions cannot have side effects and should not alter anything outside the function.
- Pure functions cannot rely on external variables or state.
- Pure functions are easier to test and ensure code quality.
- Pure functions can be analyzed in isolation without considering the rest of the application.
- Pure functions result in fewer bugs and are beneficial in larger codebases.
- Pure functions are important in both functional programming and object-oriented programming approaches.

## I asked for more detailed bullet points
Sure, here are the main points of the lesson with a bit more detail:

- Pure functions always return the same output for a given input, which means they are deterministic and predictable. For example, the function `addOne(num)` will consistently return `num + 1` regardless of how many times the value 7 is passed as an argument.

- On the other hand, impure functions can produce different results with the same input. The function `guessMyNumber(num)` generates a random number and returns different messages based on whether the input matches the random number. Consequently, calling the function with the input 7 may yield different results each time.

- Pure functions always return an output and cannot return nothing. It is a fundamental requirement for a function to be considered pure.

- Pure functions do not have side effects, which means they do not modify anything outside the function's scope. In contrast, impure functions, such as `addWord(word)`, manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) by appending a word to an element. They alter external state, making them impure.

- Pure functions should not rely on external variables or state. Depending on external variables can introduce unpredictability and cause different return values for the same input. The example with the `tallyScore(roundScore)` method shows how a function's return value can vary based on the object's current state, making it impure.

- Pure functions are easier to test because they have consistent outputs for given inputs. This property allows for simpler test cases and more confidence in the code's behavior.

- Pure functions can be analyzed independently, as they do not interact with external factors or rely on the state of the application. This isolation makes them easier to reason about and understand.

- Due to their predictability and independence, pure functions result in fewer bugs. Their reliable behavior and reduced complexity make it easier to identify and prevent issues, particularly in larger codebases.

- Writing pure functions is not limited to functional programming; even in an object-oriented perspective, using pure functions brings benefits in terms of testability, maintainability, and code quality.

In summary, pure functions exhibit consistent behavior, have no side effects, don't rely on external variables or state, and provide advantages such as easier testing, isolated analysis, and reduced bugs in both functional and object-oriented programming paradigms.

## I asked chat to add more of it's own input
Certainly! Here's an expanded version that includes additional input to illustrate the points in the lesson:

- Pure functions always return the same output for a given input. This property makes them reliable and predictable. Imagine a pure function called `double(num)`, which simply doubles the value of the input `num`. If you call `double(5)` multiple times, it will consistently return `10`. This predictability allows you to trust the function's behavior and build your code with confidence.

- On the other hand, impure functions can produce different results with the same input, leading to unexpected outcomes. Consider an impure function called `getRandomNumber()`, which generates a random number each time it's called. If you invoke `getRandomNumber()` multiple times, you'll get different results each time. This unpredictability can introduce bugs and make it challenging to reason about the code's behavior.

- Pure functions always return an output and cannot return nothing. This requirement ensures that every function call has a meaningful result. For instance, a pure function `square(num)` takes a number as input and returns its square. It always has an output, ensuring that the function's purpose is clear and consistent.

- Pure functions do not have side effects, meaning they don't modify any external state or variables outside their scope. Imagine a pure function called `sumArray(arr)`, which takes an array of numbers and returns their sum. This function only performs calculations on the provided array and does not modify any variables outside its scope. By avoiding side effects, pure functions promote code clarity and prevent unintended consequences.

- Impure functions, on the other hand, can have side effects and modify external state. Consider a function called `addToCart(item)`, which adds an item to a shopping cart. This function not only returns a value but also has the side effect of altering the shopping cart's state. Side effects can make code more challenging to reason about and lead to bugs when dealing with shared or mutable state.

- Pure functions should not rely on external variables or state. By eliminating dependencies on external factors, pure functions become self-contained and easier to understand. Let's say you have a pure function called `calculateTax(amount)`, which calculates the tax based on a given amount. This function does not depend on any global variables or external state. Its behavior solely relies on the input provided, making it more modular and reusable.

- Pure functions are easier to test because their behavior is deterministic and consistent. Testing pure functions involves providing different inputs and verifying the expected outputs. Since pure functions do not rely on external factors or have side effects, you can write focused test cases that cover various scenarios. This ease of testing allows for better code coverage and more confidence in the correctness of the code.

- Pure functions can be analyzed independently without considering the broader application. This isolation makes them easier to reason about and debug. You can focus on the inputs and outputs of a pure function without worrying about its interaction with other parts of the codebase. This simplification aids in understanding, maintaining, and refactoring code.

- Due to their reliability and independence, pure functions result in fewer bugs. By adhering to the principles of pure functions, you reduce the complexity and potential sources of errors in your code. The deterministic nature of pure functions, combined with their lack of side effects, makes it easier to identify and fix issues, leading to more robust and bug-free software.

- It's important to write pure functions not only when following a functional programming paradigm but also when adopting an object-oriented approach. Pure functions bring benefits regardless of the programming style. They improve testability, code quality, and maintainability by providing clarity, reducing complexity, and minimizing the impact of external factors.

In summary, pure functions ensure predictability, clarity, and maintainability in your
